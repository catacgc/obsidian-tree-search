# Automatically building a graph

The plugin works by scanning (using dataview) all files in your vault and creating links based on the outline.
It doesn't stop only at notes, but also includes headers, tasks, tags, and web links.

Consider an example vault as follows:

![img_2.png](img_2.png)

On the right side you can see the full graph being built by the plugin for the root note.

(If you wonder how the Example Graph note is created have a look at the [tree-context](/tree-context/index) macro)
