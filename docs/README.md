# Obsidian TreeSearch Plugin

Obsidian is good at linking notes together. What this plugin does is to add another layer to the linking
capabilities of Obsidian, namely hierarchical linking and in-context searching.

## Installing

- Install BRAT plugin from the Obsidian Community Plugins
- With Brat, install the TreeSearch plugin by adding a beta plugin with the following URL: https://github.com/catacgc/obsidian-tree-search
- Make sure you have Dataview installed

## Features

- [Zero-effort network of relations](/graph/build) between all notes in your vault: notes, headers, tasks, tags, and web pages
- Powerful, fast (and graph aware) search capabilities: [Search](/search/index)
- Supercharged backlinks view (File Context): [File Context](/file-context/index)
- In-page Markdown processor (`tree-context`) to show a map of content in a note: [Markdown Processor](/tree-context/index)
